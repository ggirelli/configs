Over time, I have been trying to document how I setup my Linux machines.
You will find some config file examples and instructions on how to fix any bugs
I encountered on the way.

1. Ubuntu
   - [[First setup: Ubuntu 21.10|Ubuntu 21.10]]
   - 22.04: see 21.10 (no issues found upon upgrade from 21.10).
   - [[First setup: Ubuntu 24.04|Ubuntu 24.04]]
   - [[First setup: Ubuntu 25.04|Ubuntu 25.04]]
     - Due to an issue with upgrading from encrypted ZFS I switched to LVM.
2. VCSs
   1. [[First setup: git|Git]]
   2. [[First setup: jujutsu|Jujutsu]]
