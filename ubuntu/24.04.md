> Assumes LVM encrypted installation.

## First actions

- [ ] Start with a normal update cycle.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt autoremove
```

- [ ] Install some key utilities.

```bash
sudo apt install htop btop numix-gtk-theme numix-icon-theme \
                 numix-icon-theme-circle gnome-tweaks screen \
                 git inkscape gimp vlc lyx zsh \
                 net-tools stress lm-sensors cifs-utils alien \
                 openssh-server libffi-dev \
                 gnome-shell-extension-manager \
                 ubuntu-restricted-extras dconf-editor \
                 fuse
```

## Appearance

- [ ] Change system theme to "Dark" in Settings > Appearance.
- [ ] Change wallpaper.
- [ ] Open the `tweaks` application and, under "Appearance", select the "Numix-circle" icons.

  - NOTE: opening Settings > Appearance at any point after this will undo the icons selection.

- [ ] Enable night light in Ubuntu's Display settings.
- [ ] Change desktop background. This can be done via `tweaks`.
- [ ] Customize desktop settings.

## Technical

- [ ] Update swap by creating a new swapfile of 32 GB with the following commands.
      Assuming the current swap file is located at `swap.img`.

```bash
swapoff -v /swap.img
fallocate -l 32G /swap.img
mkswap /swap.img
swapon /swap.img
```

- [ ] If new build, check temperature behaviours with `stress` and `sensors`  
       (or `bashtop` with temperature option turned on).

- [ ] Add external network drives to `sudo nano /etc/fstab`, and then mount them with `sudo mount -a`.

  - Good to add option `x-systemd.automount` to avoid stalling or crashing at boot.
